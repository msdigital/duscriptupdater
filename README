# Dual Universe LUA Updater

Small Tool to update LUA Scripts automatically.

### Prerequisites

Dual Universe ;)

### Installing

Standalone NodeJS Project, so no Installation needed.

### Run the Updater

1. Add URIs (only URIs directyl to files are working right now) to the `lua_scripts.conf` File
2. Doubleclick `StartAPP.bat` to start the Updater
3. With the first Start, the app will ask you for the Game Directory (eg. C:\Dual Universe\)
4. Wait until the Script downloaded all LUA Scripts.
5. Enjoy!

> NOTE: There are already two usefull Scripts inside the `lua_scripts.conf` to show you how it should look like.

## Troubleshooting

If you're getting one of these Messages, please do the following:

`Your Game Path seems wrong! Please enter again!`
Delete the `config.json` File and start the App. It will ask you again for the Game Directory.

`Couldn't find any lua script download links!`
Add Links to the `lua_scripts.conf` File.

`ERROR: whatever-the-error-is`
Looks like something unexpected happened, don't bother to open an issue and i'll take a look into it.
